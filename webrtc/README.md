## Motivation

1. **No need for valid TLS certificates.** Enable browsers to connect to public
   server nodes without those server nodes providing a TLS certificate within
   the browsers trustchain. Note that we can not do this today with our
   Websocket transport.

2. **Hole punching in the browser**: Enable two browsers or a browser and a
   non-public server node to connect.

## Requirements

- Loading a remote nodes certificate into ones browser trust-store is not an
  option, i.e. doesn't scale.

- No dependency on central STUN and/or TURN servers.

## Protocol

### Browser to Server

Scenario: Browser _A_ wants to connect to server node _B_.

#### Setup - Both _A_ and _B_

1. [Generate a
   certificate](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-generatecertificate).

2. [Get the certificate's
   fingerprint](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#dom-rtccertificate-getfingerprints).

#### Connection Establishment

1. Browser _A_ discovers server node _B_'s multiaddr, containing _B_'s IP, UDP
  port, TLS certificate fingerprint and libp2p peer ID (e.g.
  `/ip6/2001:db8::/udp/1234/webrtc/<tls-certificate-fingerprint/p2p/<peer-id>`),
  through some external mechanism.

2. _A_ create a connection with its local certificate.

3. _A_ constructs _B_'s SDP offer locally based on _B_'s multiaddr and sets it
   via
   [`RTCPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription).

4. _A_ establishes the connection to _B_.

5. _A_ initiates some authentication handshake _X_ to _B_ on a datachannel,
   where _X_ allows _A_ and _B_ to authenticate each other's peer IDs. _X_ could
   for example be Noise. See WebTransport specification as an example
   https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/404. Still to be specified here for
   WebRTC.

6. On success of the authentication handshake _X_, the used datachannel is
   closed and the plain WebRTC connection is used with its multiplexing
   capabilities via datachannels.

### Browser to Browser

Scenario: Browser _A_ wants to connect to Browser node _B_ with the help of
server node _R_.

- Replace STUN with libp2p's identify and AutoNAT
  - https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify
  - https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/README.md
- Replace TURN with libp2p's Circuit Relay v2
  - https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/relay/circuit-v2.md

## Open Questions

_Where _Browser_ is replaced with the major desktop browsers of today (Chrome,
Safari, Edge, Firefox)._

### Direct connections

#### Browser to public server node

- Can _Browser_ generate a _valid_ SDP packet for the remote node based on the
  remote's Multiaddr, where that Multiaddr contains the IP, UDP port and TLS
  certificate fingerprint (e.g.
  `/ip6/2001:db8::/udp/1234/webrtc/<tls-certificate-fingerprint`)? _Valid_ in
  the sense that this generated SDP packet can then be used to establish a
  WebRTC connection to the remote.

- Do the major (Go / Rust / ...) WebRTC implementations allow us to accept a
  WebRTC connection from a remote node without previously receiving an SDP
  packet from such host?

  How does the server learn the TLS certificate fingerprint of the browser? Is
  embedding A's TLS certificate fingerprint in A's STUN message USERNAME
  attribute a valid option?

#### Browser to browser or non-public server node

- Can _Browser_ know upfront its UDP port which it is listening for incoming
  connections on?

- Can _Browser_ control the lifecycle of its local TLS certificate, i.e. can
  _Browser_ use the same TLS certificate for multiple WebRTC connections?

- Can two _Browsers_ exchange their SDP packets via a third server node using
  Circuit Relay v2 and DCUtR? Instead of exchanging the original SDP packets,
  could they exchange their multiaddr and construct the remote's SDP packet
  based on it?

### Securing the connection

While WebRTC offers confidentiality and integrity via TLS, one still needs to
authenticate the remote peer by its libp2p identity.

- Can a _Browser_ access the fingerprint of its TLS certificate?

  Chrome allows you to access the fingerprint of any locally-created certificate
  directly via `RTCCertificate#getFingerprints`. Firefox does not allow you to
  do so. Browser compatibility can be found
  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCCertificate). In
  practice, this is not an issue since the fingerprint is embedded in the local
  SDP string.

- Is the above proposed #protocol secure?

### Multiplexing

- Can we use WebRTCâ€™s data channels in _Browser_ to multiplex a single
  connection, or do we need to run an additional multiplexer (e.g. yamux) on top
  of a WebRTC connection and WebRTC datachannel? In other words, does WebRTC
  provide all functionality of a libp2p muxer like Yamux (e.g. flow control)?

# FAQ

- _Why exchange the TLS certificate fingerprint in the multiaddr? Why not
  base it on the libp2p public key?_

  Browsers do not allow loading a custom certificate. One can only generate a
  certificate via
  [rtcpeerconnection-generatecertificate](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-generatecertificate).

- _Why not embed the peer ID in the TLS certificate, thus rendering the
  additional "peer certificate" exchange obsolete?_

  Browsers do not allow editing the properties of the TLS certificate.

- _How about distributing the multiaddr in a signed peer record, thus rendering
  the additional "peer certificate" exchange obsolete?_

  Signed peer records are not yet rolled out across the many libp2p protocols.
  Making the libp2p WebRTC protocol dependent on the former is not deemed worth
  it at this point in time. Later versions of the libp2p WebRTC protocol might
  adopt this optimization.

  Note, one can role out a new version of the libp2p WebRTC protocol through a
  new multiaddr protocol, e.g. `/webrtc-2`.

- _Why do an authentication handshake on top of an established WebRTC
  connection? Why not only exchange signatures of ones TLS fingerprint signed
  with ones libp2p private key?_

  This is prone to replay attacks.
