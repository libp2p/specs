# Identify

> The identify protocol is used to exchange basic information with other peers
> in the network, including addresses, public keys, and capabilities.

## Versions

There are currently two versions of the identify protocol:

- `/p2p/id/2.0.0`: [identify-v2.0.0.md](./identify-v2.0.0.md)
- `/ipfs/id/1.0.0`: [identify-v1.0.0.md](./identify-v1.0.0.md)

`/ipfs/id/1.0.0` is considered deprecated. `/p2p/id/2.0.0` should be used instead.
